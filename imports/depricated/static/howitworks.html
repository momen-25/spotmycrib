            <h3>SpotMyCrib is Ireland's first, transparent online letting application platform created with an objective of bringing in a transparent price discovery methodology to the Irelands real estate.
            </h3>
            <span class="bottom-line"></span>

            <p>Our objective is to bring in technology led, disruptive innovations into the Real Estate Space so as to deliver unprecedented value to genuine buyers of real estate in Ireland. </p>

            <p>Auctions across the world are considered as one of the most transparent methods for buyers and sellers to transact in real estate and is specifically favored by buyers, as it gives them an opportunity to buy prime, pre-screened real estate at off-market prices. Thoughtful features like pre-screening of projects / developers, real time auction statistics, real time bidding are all assigned to further help buyers take more informed decisions. The empowering feeling of "Choosing a Price to Bid & Buy", we believe, will enable aggregation of buyers and propel transactions. The business motive however is driven by an unwavering commitment to offer buyers only prime, high quality real estate Properties.
