We also take ID proofs, references from our users as a supporting document for their letting application. We respect everyone's personal information, and it makes perfect sense for us to have one privacy policy and set of procedures to protect everyone's interests, including compliance with applicable local laws.</p>\n                                    <h4>What personal information does SpotMyCrib process on behalf of its customers?</h4>\n                                    <ol>\n                                        <li>We collect and maintain personal contact details which includes contact name, job title, email address, telephone number, and company name. If the customer is an individual sole proprietor or unaffiliated with any commercial or non-profit entity, it's possible that additional information such as street address and credit cardholder data is included.</li>\n                                        <li>All customer data, that is, data controlled by our customers which we process according to their instructions, is appropriately classified as Confidential. This confidential data could contain personally-identifiable information about our Customers' End Users, which we cannot identify because it is encrypted and not accessible by SpotMyCrib staff.</li>\n                                        <li>We also collect personal identity information as references to users application to a property.

Data subjects are people from whom or about whom you collect information in connection with your business and its operations. Your obligations with regard to data subjects and their personal data depend on whether you're considered a controller or a processor under GDPR.</p>\n                                    <ul>\n                                        <li>Data Controllers</li>\n                                    </ul>\n                                    <p>GDPR defines a data controller as \"the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.\" In other words, if your organization processes personal data for your own organization's purposes and needs-not merely as a service provider acting on behalf of another organization-then you are likely to be a data controller.</p>\n                                    <p>SpotMyCrib is a Data Controller for our direct customers.</p>\n                                    <ul>\n                                        <li>Data Processor</li>\n                                    </ul>\n                                    <p>Businesses or organizations that process personal data solely on behalf of, and as directed by, data controllers are data processors. In other words, when a data controller outsources a data processing function to another entity, that other entity is generally a data processor.</p>\n                                    <p>For purposes of the GDPR, SpotMyCrib is also considered a Data Processor for our customers' end-users.</p>\n                                    <h4>What steps is SpotMyCrib taking to ensure GDPR compliance?</h4>\n                                    <ol>\n                                        <li>We conducted an internal review of all data our data points, how its collected, stored and how it's being used.</li>\n                                        <li>We conducted an internal Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) to discover what information we collect, and how it's being used.</li>\n                                        <li>We will provide users and customers with resources and helpful information about privacy and GDPR, including whitepapers and blog posts.</li>\n                                        <li>We will announce an update of our Privacy Policy for GDPR.</li>\n                                    </ol>\n                                    <h3>Our Customers and the GDPR</h3>\n                                    <h4>As a SpotMyCrib customer, what are my main responsibilities under the GDPR?</h4>\n                                    <p>SpotMyCrib customers are responsible for protecting the personal information of their end users, as Data Controllers and/or Data Exporters.</p>\n                                    <p>Your responsibilities under GDPR will depend on the nature of your business and your personal data processing activities.
